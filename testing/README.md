# Testing

In this lab we created a small testing project.
The project creation was done using `maven`.

We create a maven-project in Eclipse using `File` -> `New...` -> `Maven Project`.
The archetype we chose was Maven's "quickstart" archetype
(GroupID: `org.apache.maven.archetypes`, ArtifactID: `maven-archetype-quickststart`).

We then edited the pom.xml file and exchanged the JUnit dependency to 4.12 to use a newer version.
